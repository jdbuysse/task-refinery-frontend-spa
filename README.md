# task-refinery-frontend-spa
Task Refinery is a lightweight, Kanban-style tool for tracking progress on small tasks. It has auth capabilities but allows users to rapidly create lists and choose to persist them or retrieve old boards at will.

I designed this as a modularized, vanilla javascript app I wrote as I learned:
	Django REST framework
	JWT auth and custom permissions
	Async/Await fetch requests
	SPA design (refactored from a multipage design to what you see here)
	Flexbox
	Localstorage api
